There are a number of ways that programming languages have for obtaining values
as the result of calculations, with names like functions, futures, actions,
callables, runnables, and so forth. The operators grouped here under the `Start`
operator category make these things behave like Observables so that they can be
chained with other Observables in an Observable cascade.
